TO-DO
* Teach creeps to act like harvesters if there are no harvesters
* Consider having the room manager direct creeps according to body rather than name
* Automatically determine where to build containers
* Teach builders to repair structures before they collapse, even when build sites are available
* Implement maximum body for creeps
* Teach builders not to repair if there's a tower with energy
* Create a base configuration file from which structures are built and defined
* Distribute the importers among different neighboring sources
* Scouts need to go into neighboring rooms even if they're visible
* Respawn harvesters, distributors, and scavengers if the available energy represents a significant upgrade
* Teach creep with no target to move to a space with nothing around it
* Stop distributors from freaking out and dancing around the spawn when a new creep is spawning
* Figure out why distributors aren't dropping energy into containers, but standing next to them holding energy instead
* Make one code improvement: Move give energy and take energy logic by class out of the creep ancestor
* Explicitly define the order in which creeps should spawn
* Explicitly define the order in which creeps should work
* Creeps should not shove other creeps out of the way until all their move alternatives are examined
* Creeps that cannot take energy because the spawns and extensions are not full should move to where they'll take energy from when they can
* Don't spawn a scout for a neighboring room that can't be reached
* Use PathFinder to find paths
* Teach importers to drop energy into links
* Teach distributors to get energy from links
* Add expirations to cached paths
* Builders should clear the structure cache for a room when they complete a construction
* Importers should deliver their energy when their source is depleted
* Distributors are putting energy into containers and taking it right back out again
* Teach creeps to remember the route to their target rather than looking it up from UtilPath again and again
